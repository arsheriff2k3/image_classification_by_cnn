# Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This code demonstrates image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It aims to classify images of cats and dogs.

## Code Overview

The code is structured as follows:
- Importing necessary libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, Keras
- Loading and preprocessing the image dataset
- Data exploration and cleaning
- Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
- Creating data generators for image augmentation
- Building a CNN model using Keras Sequential API
- Compiling and training the model
- Evaluating the model's performance using accuracy and loss metrics
- Visualizing the training history
- Testing the model on a real image

## How to Run the Code

1. Install the required libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, Keras.
2. Download the "PetImages" dataset and place it in the appropriate directory.
3. Open the code in a Python IDE or Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run the code step by step or in its entirety.

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the validation set after XX epochs. The loss decreased steadily during training, indicating effective learning.

## Conclusion

The CNN model demonstrated promising results in classifying images of cats and dogs. Further improvements can be made by adjusting hyperparameters, exploring different architectures, or using more extensive datasets.
